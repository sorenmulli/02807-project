## Data Analysis of Election 2022 Candidate Tweets

On the 1st of November 2022, following a four-week election period, voting took place for seats in the Danish
National Parliament with a historic 14 eligible political parties. While Facebook is the dominant social
medium for the general Danish population, a large number of politicians are active on Twitter, and it
has been characterised as a unique discussion hub with immense influence on media and politics.
We examine the Twitter use of candidates for Parliament during the election using data analysis methods such as
social network graphs. We carry out an explorative analysis with the goal of shedding light on the following open
questions of importance for the electorate: What were the most important discussion themes in the election?
Did candidates mainly interact in separate sub-communities, as suggested by the social media echo chamber
effect? How did the different political parties and party blocs differ in their use of Twitter?
